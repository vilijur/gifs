# Important Information regarding organization

Files in these folders are organised in the following format:
* `CharacterName > Attack (Something like bair, fair, dair, uair, nair, da, ftilt, etc...) > Air (Only Applies to Special moves, which can be done in the air or not. Some characters may have some exceptions, others may not.) Ratio (Square, Autocrop, Split, Original.) > Alt (1 to 8) > Length (Full woult be the entire animation until it reaches idle, cut would mean some frames have been removed, which is usually done to make it look better. Some gifs will not have this label) > Size (Small, this one is optional).gif`

For the `Moves` folder, there are folders with the names of the type of moves, which contain character names. These folders are organised differently:
* `Moves (This is the main directory, assume this folder is the "root" directory of an external drive) > Attack folders (Air Attacks, Dash Attacks, Get-up Attacks, Smash Attacks, Special Moves, Standard Attacks, Throws and grabs, Titl Attacks. These folders are catagories for moves) > CharacterName > Move (The contents depend on the catagory you're in. I.E, if you're in Air Attacks, you'll see Forward Air, Back Air, Down Air, Up Air, and Neutral Air folders, assuming that character has animations made for all those moves)`

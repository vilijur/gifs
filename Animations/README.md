# Important Information regarding organization

Files are organised in the following format:
* `CharacterName > Animation > Ratio (Square, Autocrop, Split, Original) > Alt (1 to 8) > Size (Small, this one is optional)`

Folders are organised in the following format:
* `Animations (This is the "root" directory for the main gifs) > Type of animation (I.E, Walking) > CharacterName.`
* For the `Moves` folder, there are folders with the names of the type of moves, which contain character names. These folders are organised differently. See the README.md in the `Moves` folder for more information

# Smash gifs
Hi there! This is a repository of all of my Super Smash Bros. Ultimate gifs that I've made avaiable for easy access.

# How to navigate?
Navigation is quite simple. If you can browse a GitHub repository, you'll be just fine! Don't worry if you can't, just [click here](https://github.com/vilijur/gifs/tree/main/Animations) to go to the folder which contains everything!

## What about downloading?
That's simple, just browse through the folders until you find the gif you want, click on the file name to preview it, and click that button that says `Download`. Hard to miss, really! You may get redirected to a page that just has the gif file, in which case just right click, save, choose where to save it to, and you're done!

# Can I request gifs?
Short answer: no
Slightly less short answer: I'm not accepting gif requests right now, I have a billion to go through first. Sorry!

# When do you upload a gif?
Usually a few minutes after the request is completed.

# My question isn't answered here!
Oh? Feel free to shoot a question my way. You can do so on GitHub or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vilijur) (or on Discord if you have me added there already). Just don't ask me about how to use GitHub, that's something for you to search up.

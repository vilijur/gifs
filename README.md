# Smash gifs
This is a repository of all of my Super Smash Bros. Ultimate gifs that I've made avaiable for easy access.

# How to navigate?
Navigation is quite simple. If you can browse a GitHub repository, you'll be just fine! Don't worry if you can't, just [click here](https://github.com/vilijur/gifs/tree/main/Animations) to go to the folder which contains everything!

## What about downloading?
That's simple, just browse through the folders until you find the gif you want, click on the file name to preview it, and click that button that says `Download`. Hard to miss, really! You may get redirected to a page that just has the gif file, in which case just right click, save, choose where to save it to, and you're done!

# Can I request gifs?
Short answer: no
Slightly less short answer: I'm not accepting gif requests.

# Will you make any more gifs?
No, this remains as a public archive of the few gifs I did make
